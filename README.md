# Blog-App

It is a full-stack app made for writing , reading and deleting blogs . 


## Tech Stack used:
Node , React , Express , MongoDB ,Google OAuth , Unsplash API 
## Features:
i)clean and cool UI/UX\
ii)for authentication , Google OAuth is used\
iii)the app is responsive on pc as well as mobile
(atleast verified for the dimensions provided on browser)\
iv)you can add image based on your topic to the blog thanks to Unsplash API\
v)you can logout anytime\
vi)read , write and delete a blog \
vii)displays keyword based on the blog and the date on which it is published

## Cons:
i) need to add a ratings feature (data is less so it seems not necessary)\
ii)need to add Admin panel\
iii)for now , anyone can  delete a blog ; need to make it restricted only for the one who has written it\
iv)sometimes loading the blogs (or fetching data from database)
takes more than 1 minute , tho after loading once , it becomes fast\
v)need to give more facilities to the writer (like styling elements to include in their writing)\
vi)need to add the facility of including images inside the blog body as well
